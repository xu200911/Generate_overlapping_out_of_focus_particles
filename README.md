# Generate_overlapping_out_of_focus_particles
Mainly generates overlapping out-of-focus particles for deep learning and measurement method verification.
% This method has been patented and is only used for academic research. If used, please use the paper
% OLR concept can refer to Xu, R., Z. Huang, W. Gong, W. Zhou, and C. Tropea. 2024. Depth from defocus technique for high number densities and non-spherical particles. Measurement, accepted for publication .
%The program only generates the overlap of two particles. The author will update the generation of multiple particles later.
